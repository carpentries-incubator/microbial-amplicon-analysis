title: "Beta diversity"
teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What is beta diversity and how do I calculate it?"
- "How can I plot beta diversity and interpret the results?"
objectives:
- "Understand what beta diversity means from an ecology standpoint"
- "Understand the most common methods of beta diversity calculations, including their relative strengths and weaknesses"
- "Be able to plot beta diversity and interpret the results"
- "Be able to perform cluster analysis on beta diversity and interpret the results"
keypoints:
- "Beta diversity measures the diversity _between_ samples in a dataset"
- "The most common beta diversity measures are Bray-Curtis, Weighted/Unweighted Unifrac, and NMDS"
- "Beta diversity is usually displayed as a principal coordinates plot"
- "Cluster analysis can identify groups of samples, but care must be taken to be sure the groups are meaningful"

Exercise: Describe what Beta Diversity means from an ecology standpoint. (In an Etherpad?)
Exercise: Calculate beta diversity using Bray-Curtis ordination and plot
Exercise: Calculate beta diversity with Weighted/Unweighted Unifrac and NMDS and plot. Explain the differences amongn them
Exercise: Perform cluster analysis on the above beta diversities to identify clusters in the data
