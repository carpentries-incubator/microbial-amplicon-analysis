title: "Demultiplexing Reads"
teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How do I demultiplex reads from different samples?"
objectives:
- "Understand how read barcodes function"
- "Demultiplex reads from several samples into separate files"
keypoints:
- "Barcodes let us sequence many samples at the same time and separate them computationally"
- "Most pipelines require demultiplexing reads as a first step"

Exercise: Demultiplex a small set of reads by hand
Exercise: Use a computational tool (FIXME: Which?) to demultiplex a small dataset. (Does not have to be the same one as later lesson steps.)
