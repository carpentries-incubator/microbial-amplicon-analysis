title: "Alpha Diversity"
teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What is alpha diversity and how do I calculate it?"
objectives:
- "Explain what Alpha Diversity represents in a sample"
- "Calculate alpha diversity using several common metrics"
- "Understand which metrics require singletons and why some methods are unsuitable for them"
- "Interpret what differences in alpha diversity mean between samples"
keypoints:
- "Alpha diversity measures the diversity _within_ a given sample"
- "There are many ways to calculate alpha diversity; be sure the method(s) you use are applicable to your dataset"
- "Comparing alpha diversity among samples shows their relative diversity"
- "Direct comparisons of alpha diversity require samples to have the same sequencing depth" FIXME: Confirm if this is the case

Exercise: Calculate alpha diversity in sample(s) using Observed OTUs
Exercise: Calculate with different metrics: Chao1, FaithPD, Simpson, ObservedOTUs...
Exercise: Plot the results in a meaningful manner (e.g., violin plots) and interpret the results
Bonus Exercise: Look at the correlation between metrics; how well are they correlated

Exercise: Use a metric that requires singletons on data that has no singletons. Note lack of warning, and how results change (e.g., if filtered out singletons)
