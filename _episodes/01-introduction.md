questions:
- "What is amplicon analysis?"
objectives:
- "Explain what amplicon analysis is."
- "Explain the differences between 16S, ITS, and other amplicon analyses, and how they differ from metagenomics."
- "Describe the basic amplicon analysis workflow, starting from samples and ending with biological insight."
keypoints:
- "Amplicons are short stretches of DNA that are amplified and sequenced."
- "The most common use of amplicon analysis is to study complex microbial communities."
- "Ribosomal RNA is one of the most common genes used for making amplicons. Bacterial analysis usually focused on 16S hypervariable regions, while fungal analysis focuses on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences"
